###  From Ubuntu's /etc/inputrc
set input-meta on
set output-meta on

### Don't suggest hidden files unless the dot(.) is provided
set match-hidden-files off

set completion-ignore-case on

### Don't show Display all XXX possibilities? (y or n)
### OTHERWISE sometimes the command will be executed by pybcompgen, which can be very wrong... (eg: 'rm -rf /' !?)
### eg: completing "find " on a folder with many files without the below set will slow down noticably because "find" is executing
### NOTE2: now the command to complete is prefixed with a void function, in theory should prevent the above from happening
set completion-query-items 0

set show-all-if-ambiguous on

set completion-display-width 0

# set skip-completed-text on

### Others?
